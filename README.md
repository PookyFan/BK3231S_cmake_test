# BK3231S SKD (ported to CMAKE project)

This code was ported from [AriesTian's BM3231](https://github.com/AriesTian/BM3231) repository. Most of it remained untouched, only some fixes and changes required for smooth building using GCC were applied (plus some actual code fixes and additional debug measures).
If you want to use it, build it with CMAKE to generate firmware image (ARM compiler is needed, recommendation is `arm-none-eabi` flavor of GCC). By doing that, three files will appear in `build/bin` directory: an ELF binary (`fw` file), raw binary blob (`fw.bin` file) and encrypted binary with attached default configuration, padded to the size of BK3231S's internal flash memory (`fw.img` file). The last one is the one you'd be using to flash your device.

**As of now, Bluetooth communication doesn't work (JDY-31 module used for tests doesn't appear while looking for BT devices on PC/smartphone). Use it at your own risk, as there is no guarantee for this code to work (properly/at all). Dumping previous firmware before flashing new image is recommended so that you could get back to default working state of device you're going to program using this code.**
